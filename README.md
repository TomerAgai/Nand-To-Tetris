# Nand to Tetris Projects 1-11

This repository contains my solutions to the Nand to Tetris course projects, also known as "The Elements of Computing Systems." I have completed projects 1-11, which cover building a modern computer from first principles and the construction of a software hierarchy.

## Course Overview

Nand to Tetris is a project-based course that teaches students how to build a computer system from scratch. The course is divided into two parts:

1. Part I: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles (Chapters 1-6) - Covers the construction of the hardware, from basic NAND gate to the ALU, memory, and CPU.
2. Part II: Building a Modern Software Hierarchy (Chapters 7-12) - Covers the construction of an assembler, virtual machine, compiler, and operating system to run high-level programs on the computer built in Part I.

## Projects

Below is a list of the projects I completed:

1. Project 1: Elementary Logic Gates
2. Project 2: Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
3. Project 3: Sequential Logic and Memory
4. Project 4: Machine Language and CPU
5. Project 5: Computer Architecture
6. Project 6: Assembler
7. Project 7: Virtual Machine I: Stack Arithmetic
8. Project 8: Virtual Machine II: Program Control
9. Project 9: High-Level Language
10. Project 10: Compiler I: Syntax Analysis
11. Project 11: Compiler II: Code Generation

## Usage

Each project directory contains the relevant HDL (Hardware Description Language) files, assembly files, or high-level language files, along with any necessary test scripts and test files.

To run the projects, you'll need the Nand to Tetris software suite, which includes the necessary tools and simulators. The software suite can be downloaded from the [official website](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software).
